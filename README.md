# ChaosKB

A personal knowledge base for saving and searching web articles. All intelligence — content fetching, text extraction, chunking, embedding, searching, encryption — runs on your device. The server is an optional encrypted blob store for backup and multi-device sync.

## How it works

1. Save a URL (via chat agent, share sheet, or CLI)
2. The client fetches, chunks, and embeds the article on-device
3. Everything is encrypted before leaving the device
4. Search your knowledge base with natural language — locally, instantly

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @de-otio/chaoskb-client
```

That's it. On first launch, ChaosKB detects your SSH key, enables sync automatically, and encrypts your data with your public key. No setup commands, no accounts, no configuration.

## Clients

- **Desktop** — `@de-otio/chaoskb-client`, an npm package that runs as an MCP server for any compatible chat agent (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, etc.)
- **Mobile** (future) — Flutter app for iOS and Android

## Key properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Privacy | Server never sees plaintext — opaque ciphertext only |
| Offline | Fully functional without a server |
| Search | On-device embedding + brute-force cosine similarity (<50ms) |
| Encryption | XChaCha20-Poly1305, HKDF-SHA256, Argon2id |
| Server cost | ~$0.25/mo (DynamoDB + Lambda), or $0 in local-only mode |

## Security tiers

| Tier | Key management | Recovery |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **Standard** (default) | Your SSH key | Same SSH key on new device restores everything |
| **Maximum** | Passphrase you choose | Re-enter passphrase on new device |

Both tiers are end-to-end encrypted — the server stores only ciphertext it cannot decrypt. Lose your SSH key or forget your passphrase, and your data is gone. No backdoor, no recovery phrase, no server-side key escrow.

## Self-hosting

Deploy your own backend with a single command:

```bash
npx chaoskb-deploy
```

This creates a Lambda Function URL + DynamoDB table in your AWS account. See [self-hosting docs](doc/design/self-hosting.md).
